Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows. When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches i.e. breaks out of the egg's shell. Some embryos have a temporaryWhale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother. At 1.5 kg 3.3 lb and up to 17.8 cm x 14 cm 7.0 in x 5.5 in theproduces the smallest known bird egg which weighs half of a gram around 0.02 oz. Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish amphibians insects and other  in which the female lays undeveloped eggs that are externally fertilized by a male. Typically large numbers of eggs are laid at one time an adult femalecan produce 4-6 million eggs in one spawning and the eggs are then left to develop without parental care. When the larvae hatch from the egg they often carry the remains of the yolk in a yolk sac which continues to nourish the larvae for a few days as they learn how to swim. Once the yolk is consumed there is a critical point after which they must learn how to hunt and feed or they will die. in which the eggs are fertilized and develop internally. However the larvae still grow inside the egg consuming the egg's yolk and without any direct nourishment from the mother. The mother then gives birth to relatively mature young. In certain instances the physically most developed offspring will devour its smaller siblings for further nutrition while still within the mother's body. This is known as  with the egg being fertilized and developed internally but with the mother also providing direct nourishment. are jellylike. Cartilaginous fish sharks skates rays chimaeras eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog  it is not uncommon for pet owners to find their lone bird nesting on a clutch of unfertilized eggs which are sometimes called wind-eggs. which have to match the passerine host's egg. Most passerines in contrast lay colored eggs even if there is no need of cryptic colors. However some have suggested that the protoporphyrin markings on passerine eggs actually act to reduce brittleness by acting as a solid-state lubricant. If there is insufficient calcium available in the local soil the egg shell may be thin especially in a circle around the broad end. Protoporphyrin speckling compensates for this and increases inversely to the amount of calcium in the soil. For the same reason later eggs in a clutch are more spotted than early ones as the female's store of calcium is depleted. The color of individual eggs is also genetically influenced and appears to be inherited through the mother only suggesting that the It used to be thought that color was applied to the shell immediately before laying but subsequent research shows that coloration is an integral part of the development of the shell with the same protein responsible for depositing calcium carbonate or protoporphyrins when there is a lack of that mineral.  which nest in large groups each female's eggs have very different markings making it easier for females to identify their own eggs on the crowded cliff ledges on which they breed. this vaterite coating is thought to act as a shock absorber protecting the calcite shell from fracture during incubation such as colliding with other eggs in the nest.  with one end rounded and the other more pointed. This shape results from the egg being forced through the . Muscles contract the oviduct behind the egg pushing it forward. The egg's wall is still shapeable and the pointed end develops at the back. Long pointy eggs are an incidental consequence of having a streamlined body typical of birds with strong flying abilities flight narrows the oviduct which changes the type of egg a bird can lay. Cliff-nesting birds often have highly conical eggs. They are less likely to roll off tending instead to roll around in a tight circle this trait is likely to have arisen due to evolution via natural selection. In contrast many hole-nesting birds have nearly spherical eggs. occurs in birds when one species lays its eggs in the nest of another. In some cases the host's eggs are removed or eaten by the female or expelled by her chick. Brood parasites include the Reptile eggs are often rubbery and are always initially white. They are able to survive in the air. Often the sex of the developing embryo is determined by the temperature of the surroundings with cooler temperatures favouring males. Not all reptiles lay eggs some aremammals do not lay eggs but their unborn young do have the complex tissues that identify amniotes. are likewise macrolecithal but rather small and develop inside the body of the female but do not form afrom structures that in reptiles would form the yolk sac. Receiving nutrients from the mother the fetus completes the development while inside the uterus. organisms the zygote subsequently divides in an organised manner into smaller more specialised cells so that this new individual develops into an . In most animals the embryo is the sessile initial stage of the individual life cycle and is followed by the emergence that is the hatching of a motile stage. The zygote or the ovum itself or the sessile organic vessel containing the developing embryo may be called the egg.  selected for their role in ensuring genetic uniformity among the cells of incipient multicellular organisms. Scientists often classify animal reproduction according to the degree of development that occurs before the new individuals are expelled from the adult body and by the yolk which the egg provides to nourish the embryo. Small eggs with little yolk are called microlecithal. The yolk is evenly distributed so the cleavage of the egg cell cuts through and divides the egg into cells of fairly similar sizes. In  and either develops directly into the adult animals or forms new adult individuals through a process ofIn anatomically simple animals such as cnidarians and flatworms the fetal development can be quite short and even microlecithal eggs can undergo direct development. These small eggs can be produced in large numbers. In animals with high egg mortality microlecithal eggs are the norm as in bivalves and marine arthropods. However the latter are more complex anatomically than e.g. flatworms and the small microlecithal eggs do not allow full development. Instead the eggs hatch into In placental mammals where the embryo is nourished by the mother throughout the whole fetal period the egg is reduced in size to essentially a naked egg cell. Mesolecithal eggs have comparatively more yolk than the microlecithal eggs. The yolk is concentrated in one part of the egg the The larger yolk content of the mesolecithal eggs allows for a longer fetal development. Comparatively anatomically simple animals will be able to go through the full development and leave the egg in a form reminiscent of the adult animal. This is the situation found inAnimals with smaller size eggs or more advanced anatomy will still have a distinct larval stage though the larva will be basically similar to the adult animal as in Eggs with a large yolk are called macrolecithal. The eggs are usually few in number and the embryos have enough food to go through full fetal development in most groups. Macrolecithal eggs go through a different type of development than other eggs. Due to the large size of the yolk the cell division can not split up the yolk mass. The fetus instead develops as a plate-like structure on top of the yolk mass and only envelopes it at a later stage.  even though their eggs can be quite small. Despite their macrolecithal structure the small size of the eggs does not allow for direct development and the eggs hatch to a larval stage fry. In terrestrial animals with macrolecithal eggs the large volume to surface ratio necessitates structures to aid in transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and for storage of waste products so that the embryo does not suffocate or get poisoned from its own waste while inside the egg seecan reach a size of 9 cm 3.5 in in diameter and the young go through full development while in the Animals are commonly classified by their manner of reproduction at the most general level distinguishing egg-laying Latin. These classifications are divided into more detail according to the development that occurs before the offspring are expelled from the adult's body. Traditionally The term hemotropic derives from the Latin for blood-feeding contrasted with histotrophic for tissue-feeding. Eggs laid by many different species including birds reptiles amphibians and fish have probably been eaten by mankind for millennia. Popular choices for egg consumption are chicken duck roe and caviar but by a wide margin the egg most often humanly consumed is the chicken egg typically unfertilized. neither meat nor dairy despite being an animal product and can be mixed with either milk or kosher meat. Many vaccines for infectious diseases are produced in fertile chicken eggs. The basis of this technology was the discovery in 1931 bythat cause a variety of diseases will grow in chicken embryos. This enabled the development of vaccines against Eggs are an important symbol in folklore and mythology often representing life and rebirth healing and protection and sometimes featuring in creation myths. A popular Easter tradition in some parts of the world is the decoration of hard-boiled eggs usually by dyeing but often by hand-painting or spray-painting. Adults often hide the eggs for children to find an activity known as an . A similar tradition of egg painting exists in areas of the world influenced by the culture of Persia. Before the spring equinox in the Persian New Year tradition called Norouz each family member decorates a hard-boiled egg and sets them together in a bowl. The tradition of ais held during the feast of Corpus Christi in Barcelona and other Catalan cities since the 16th century. It consists of an emptied egg positioned over the water jet from a fountain which starts turning without falling. Although a food item raw eggs are sometimes thrown at houses cars or people. This act known commonly as in the various English-speaking countries is a minor form of vandalism and therefore usually a criminal offense and is capable of damaging property egg whites can degrade certain types of vehicle paint as well as potentially causing serious eye injury. On Halloween for example trick or treaters have been known to throw eggs and sometimes flour at property or people from whom they received nothing. Eggs are also often thrown in protests as they are inexpensive and nonlethal yet very messy when broken. Collecting eggs of wild birds is now banned by many jurisdictions as the practice can threaten rare species. In the United Kingdom the practice is prohibited by the Protection of Birds Act 1954 and Since the protection of wild bird eggs was regulated early collections have come to the museums as curiosities. For example the Australian Museum hosts a collection of about 20000 registered clutches of eggs Scientists regard egg collections as a good natural-history data as the details recorded in the collectors' notes have helped them to understand birds' nesting behaviors.",

Despite the nutritional value of eggs there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content salmonella contamination and allergy to egg proteins. There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production. In 2012 the  in both hunting societies and more recent cultures where birds were domesticated.

Eggs are a common everyday food in many parts of Asia such as China and  or luxury grocery stores. In many countries wild bird eggs are protected by laws which prohibit the collecting or selling of them or permit collection only during specific periods of the year. . The largest producers were China with 31.3 million of this total the United States with 6.3 million India at 4.8 million Mexico at 2.8 million Japan at 2.6 million and Brazil and Russia with 2.5 million each. For the month of January 2019 the United States produced 9.41 billion eggs with 8.2 billion for table consumption and 1.2 billion for raising chicks. Americans are projected to each consume 279 eggs in 2019 the highest since 1973 but less than the 405 eggs eaten per person in 1945. The size of its air cell is determined and the examination also reveals whether the egg was fertilized and thereby contains an embryo. An egg is surrounded by a thin hard shell. Thin membranes exist inside the shell. The egg yolk is suspended in the egg white by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the The larger end of the egg contains an air cell that forms when the contents of the egg cool down and contract after it is laid. Chicken eggs are graded according to the size of this air cell measured during . A very fresh egg has a small air cell and receives a grade of AA. As the size of the air cell increases and the quality of the egg decreases the grade moves from AA to A to B. This provides a way of testing the age of an egg as the air cell increases in size due to air being drawn through pores in the shell as water is lost the egg becomes less dense and the larger end of the egg will rise to increasingly shallower depths when the egg is placed in a bowl of water. A very old egg will float in the water and should not be eaten. Although there is no significant link between shell color and nutritional value often there is a cultural preference for one color over another seebelow. As candeling is less effective with brown eggs they have a significantly higher incidence of blood spots. is a clear film lining the eggshell visible when one peels a boiled egg. Primarily it composed of fibrous White is the common name for the clear liquid also called the albumen or the glairglaire contained within an egg. Colorless and transparent initially upon cooking it turns white and opaque. In chickens it is formed from the layers of secretions of the anterior section of the henand unfertilized yolks. The primary natural purpose of egg white is to protect the yolk and provide additional nutrition during the growth of thecontent is less than one percent. Egg white has many uses in food and many other applications including the preparation ofin a newly laid egg is round and firm. As the yolk ages it absorbs water from the albumen which increases its size and causes it to stretch and weaken thethe clear casing enclosing the yolk. The resulting effect is a flattened and enlarged yolk shape. A diet without such colorful foods may result in an almost colorless yolk. Yolk color is for example enhanced if the diet includes foods such as yellow . They also may be eaten raw although this is not recommended for people who may be especially susceptible to  such as the elderly the infirm or pregnant women. In addition the protein in raw eggs is only 51 percent  whereas that of a cooked egg is nearer 91 percent bioavailable meaning the protein of cooked eggs is nearly twice as absorbable as the protein from raw eggs.  and may be used in cooking separately from the yolk. The proteins in egg white allow it to form foams and aerated dishes. Egg whites may be aerated or whipped to a light fluffy consistency and often are used in desserts such asalthough the eggshell is generally discarded. Some recipes call for immature or unlaid eggs which are harvested after the hen is slaughtered or cooked while still inside the chicken. Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white and the temperature determines the gelling time. Egg yolk becomes a  or solidifies between 65 and 70 degC 149 and 158 degF. Egg white gels at different temperatures 60 to 73 degC 140 to 163 degF. The white contains exterior albumen which sets at the highest temperature. In practice in many cooking processes the white gels first because it is exposed to higher temperatures for longer. Salmonella is killed instantly at 71 degC 160 degF but also is killed from 54.5 degC 130.1 degF if held at that temperature for sufficiently long time periods. in-shell at 57 degC 135 degF for an hour and 15 minutes. Although the white then is slightly milkier the eggs may be used in normal ways. Whipping for meringue takes significantly longer but the final volume is virtually the same. If a boiled egg is overcooked a greenish ring sometimes appears around egg yolk due to changes to theChilling an overcooked egg for a few minutes in cold water until it is completely cooled may prevent the greenish ring from forming on the surface of the yolk. Peeling a cooked egg is easiest when the egg was put into boiling water as opposed to slowly heating the egg from a start in cold water. Although the age of the egg and the conditions of its storage have a greater influence the bird's diet affects the flavor of the egg.  a common snack sold from street-side carts in China are steeped in a brew from a mixture of various spices soy sauce and black tea leaves to give flavor. Careful storage of edible eggs is extremely important as an improperly handled egg may contain elevated levels of Refrigeration also preserves the taste and texture however intact eggs unwashed and unbroken may be left unrefrigerated for several months without spoiling. In Europe eggs are not usually washed and the shells are dirtier however the cuticle is undamaged and they do not require refrigeration. In the UK in particular hens are immunized against salmonella and generally their eggs are safe for 21 days. Their yolks take on an orange-red color and solidify but the white remains somewhat liquid. These often are boiled before consumption and are served with riceIf the eggs are immersed in it for a few hours the distinct red white and yellow colors may be seen when the eggs are sliced. If the eggs are marinated in the mixture for several weeks or more the vinegar will dissolve much of the shell'sstraw for several weeks to several months depending on the method of processing. After the process is completed the yolk becomes a dark green cream-like substance with a strong odor of sulfur and ammonia while the white becomes a dark brown transparent jelly with a comparatively mild distinct flavor. The transforming agent in a century egg is itsThis chemical process breaks down some of the complex flavorless proteins and fats of the yolk into simpler flavorful ones which in some way may be thought of as an inorganic version of For those who do not consume eggs alternatives used in baking include other rising agents or binding materials such as groundare made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. These products usually have added vitamins and minerals as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners such as . These allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs making possible foods such as The diet of laying hens also may affect the nutritional quality of eggs. For instance chicken eggs that are especially high in  which forage for their own food also produce eggs that are relatively enriched in omega-3 fatty acids when compared to those of cage-raised chickens. More than half the calories found in eggs come from the fat in the yolk 50 grams of chicken egg the contents of an egg just large enough to be classified as large in the US but medium in Europe contains approximately five grams of fat. People on a low-cholesterol diet may need to reduce egg consumption however only 27 percent of the fat in egg isconsists primarily of water around 90 percent and protein around 10 percent and contains no cholesterol and little if any fat. whereas other studies show that moderate consumption of eggs up to one a day does not appear to increaseargues that the cholesterol in the egg yolk is not what causes a problem because fat particularly saturated fat is much more likely to raise cholesterol levels than the consumption of cholesterol. A 2008 study by the Physicians' Health Study I 1982-2007 and the Women's Health Study 1992-2007 determined the data suggest that high levels of egg consumption daily are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes A meta-analysis from 2013 found that eating four eggs per week was associated with a 29 percent increase in the relative risk of developing diabetes. Another meta-analysis from 2013 also supported the idea that egg consumption may lead to an increased incidence of type two diabetes. A 2020 meta-analysis found that there was no overall association between moderate egg consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes.  showed that dietary phosphatidylcholine is digested by bacteria in the gut and eventually converted into the compoundstudy of 37851 men and 80082 women concluded that its findings suggest that consumption of up to 1 egg per day is unlikely to have substantial overall impact on the risk ofIn a study of 4000 people scientists found that eating eggs increased blood levels of a metabolite promoting  TMAO and that this in turn caused significantly higher risk of heart attack and stroke after three years of follow-up. A 2007 study of nearly 10000 adults demonstrated no correlation between moderate six per week egg consumption andOne potential alternative explanation for the null finding is that background dietary cholesterol may be so high in the usual Western diet that adding somewhat more has little further effect on blood cholesterol. Other research supports the idea that a high egg intake increases cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. A 2009 prospective cohort study of more than 21000 individuals suggests that egg consumption up to 6 per week has no major effect on the risk ofand mortality and that consumption of more than 7 a week is associated with a modest increased risk of total mortality in males whereas among males with diabetes any egg consumption is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and there was suggestive evidence for an increased risk ofA 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis found no association between egg consumption and cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease mortality but did find egg consumption of more than once daily increased cardiovascular disease risk 1.69-fold in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared to type 2 diabetics who ate less than one egg per week. Another 2013 meta-analysis found that eating four eggs per week increased the risk of cardiovascular disease by six percent. In 2020 two meta-analyses found that moderate egg consumption up to one egg a day is not associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk. concluded that increased egg consumption is not associated with cardiovascular disease risk in the general population. matter. In commercial practice in the US eggs are quickly washed with a sanitizing solution within minutes of being laid. The risk of infection from raw or undercooked eggs is dependent in part upon the sanitary conditions under which the hens are kept. Health experts advise people to refrigerate washed eggs use them within two weeks cook them thoroughly and never consume raw eggs.  containers and surfaces that have been used to process raw eggs should not come in contact with ready-to-eat food. A study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2002 Risk Analysis April 2002 222203-18 suggests the problem is not so prevalent in the U.S. as once thought. It showed that of the 69 billion eggs produced annually only 2.3 million are contaminated withinfection is quite rarely induced by eggs.

Food labeling practices in most developed countries now include eggs egg products and the processing of foods on equipment that also process foods containing eggs in a special allergen alert section of the ingredients on the labels.

Eggs of any quality grade may differ in weight size. for the purpose of sales. Some maxi eggs may have double-yolks and some farms separate out double-yolk eggs for special sale. Although eggshell color is a largely cosmetic issue with no effect on egg quality or taste it is a major issue in production due to regional and national preferences for specific colors and the results of such preferences on demand. For example in most regions of the  where a television jingle for years proclaimed brown eggs are local eggs and local eggs are fresh!.  white chicken eggs are generally regarded as industrial and brown or reddish ones are preferred. Small farms and  particularly in economically advanced nations may sell eggs of widely varying colors and sizes with combinations of white brown speckled red green and blue as laid by certain breeds including araucanas heritage skyline and cream leg bar eggs in the same box or carton while the supermarkets at the same time sell mostly eggs from the larger producers of the color preferred in that nation or region. reported during the Second World War that housewives in Boston preferred brown eggs and those in New York preferred white eggs. magazine in discussing issues of chicken egg color stated Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs preferring even to pay more for brown eggs although white eggs are just as good. As a result of these trends brown eggs are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered normal due to lower production. In France and the United Kingdom it is very difficult to buy white eggs with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular brown eggs. By direct contrast init is very hard to source brown eggs as demand is almost entirely for white ones with the country's largest supplier describing white eggs as table eggs and packaging brown eggs for export. Research conducted by a French institute in the 1970s demonstrated blue chicken eggs from the Chileanin 1990 revealed a number of different issues were important to Japanese housewives when deciding which eggs to buy and that color was a distinct factor with most Japanese housewives preferring the white color. Egg producers carefully consider cultural issues as well as commercial ones when selecting the breed or breeds of chickens used for production as egg color varies between breeds. Among producers and breeders brown eggs often are referred to as tinted while the speckled eggs preferred by some consumers often are referred to as being red in color. operations often involve raising the hens in small crowded cages preventing the chickens from engaging in natural behaviors such as wing-flapping dust-bathing scratching pecking perching and nest-building. Such restrictions may lead to pacing and . According to critics of the practice this can cause hens severe pain to the point where some may refuse to eat and starve to death. Some hens may beMolting can be induced by extended food withdrawal water withdrawal or controlled lighting programs. Laying hens often are slaughtered when reaching 100 to 130 weeks of age when their egg productivity starts to decline. differ from meat production strains. As male birds of the laying strain do not lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production they generally are killed soon after they hatch. laying hens are given outdoor access instead of being contained in crowded cages. Questions regarding the living conditions of free-range hens have been raised in the United States of America as there is no legal definition or regulations for eggs labeled as free-range in that country. has pushed various egg producers to promote eggs under a variety of standards. The most widespread standard in use is determined byThe United Egg Producers program includes guidelines regarding housing food water air living space beak trimming molting handling and transportation however opponents such ashave alleged UEP certification is misleading and allows a significant amount of unchecked animal cruelty. . Of these standards Certified Humane which carries requirements for stocking density and cage-free keeping and so on and Certified Organic which requires hens to have outdoor access and to be fed only organic vegetarian feed and so on are the most stringent. that must meet certain space and amenity requirements. Egg producers in many member states have objected to the new quality standards while in some countries even furnished cages and family cages are subject to be banned as well. The production standard of the eggs is visible on a mandatorycategorization where the EU egg code begins with 3 for caged chicken to 1 for free-range eggs and 0 for organic egg production. In battery cage and free-range egg production unwanted male chicks are killed at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens. In Germany in June 2019 a court decided that culling chicks violates the country's laws against killing animals without a justifiable reason. tradition in some parts of the world is a decoration of hard-boiled eggs usually by dyeing but often by spray-painting.

In addition the layers of albumen act as a cushion to protect the embryo from jarring movements while the chalazae help to maintain the orientation of the embryo within the egg.  with the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids commonly being 2 to 1. By influencing the diet of the hen some processors are able to market shell eggs with a higher ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids. Particular emphasis is being given to increasing the highly unsaturated long-chainto the hen feed. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to play a role both in normal growth and development and in the prevention of many diseases. content of a whole large egg is approximately 216 milligramsa substantially lower figure than that reported before the late 1980s when improvedtechniques were instituted.
